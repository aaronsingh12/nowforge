/**
 * One SQLite file for everything NowHelpAssist needs to remember: sessions,
 * messages, tool events, the per-instance knowledge ledger, and recall
 * embeddings.
 *
 * Why the built-in `node:sqlite` rather than better-sqlite3 — this was checked,
 * not assumed. On this machine (Node v24.18.0) the built-in covers every need:
 *
 *   DatabaseSync / StatementSync   present
 *   BLOB round-trip (Uint8Array)   works — needed for float32 embeddings
 *   FTS5 virtual tables            available — needed for the keyword fallback
 *
 * That makes the whole storage layer dependency-free, which matters here: this
 * is a Windows machine with no node-gyp toolchain, and better-sqlite3 would
 * have meant relying on a prebuilt binary matching this exact Node ABI.
 *
 * Migrations are idempotent and run on boot, keyed on `PRAGMA user_version`, so
 * starting an older or newer server against an existing file is safe.
