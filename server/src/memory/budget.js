/**
 * D-7 — budgets from reality, instead of from a bad afternoon.
 *
 * The number this replaces was 18,000 tokens for the whole request, which after
 * the measured 12,548 tokens of fixed overhead (system prompt + 37 tool
 * schemas) left the conversation 5,452 tokens to remember anything in. The
 * model is gpt-oss:120b-cloud. Read off the daemon rather than assumed:
 *
 *   $ curl -s localhost:11434/api/show -d '{"model":"gpt-oss:120b-cloud"}'
 *     "gptoss.context_length": 131072
 *
 * So the agent was using 4% of its context window, and paying for it: a single
 * turn produced THREE compaction digests (9,629 -> 4,308, 7,209 -> 3,774,
 * 6,298 -> 2,476 tokens). Every "before" is above 5,452 and every "after" is
 * below it. That is not a coincidence, it is the budget, and it thrashed
 * because each digest is appended to the SYSTEM PROMPT — so every compaction
 * raised the fixed overhead and lowered the next turn's allowance. A ratchet.
 *
 * The old constant was honestly derived; it is the derivation that expired.
 * It came from a measured cliff — ~27,900 tokens succeeding 4/8 while ~20,100
 * went 8/8 — and `retry.js` argues at length that this upstream is simply
 * flaky, with failure probability rising with size. Re-measured on 2026-08-19,
 * single attempt, no retry, five shots per size:
 *
 *    ~8,000 est (  5,798 real prompt_tokens)  5/5   avg 1044ms
 *   ~16,000 est ( 11,502 real)                5/5   avg 1356ms
 *   ~24,000 est ( 17,209 real)                5/5   avg 1456ms
 *   ~32,000 est ( 22,911 real)                5/5   avg 1204ms
 *   ~40,000 est ( 28,614 real)                5/5   avg 1465ms
 *   ~56,000 est ( 40,023 real)                5/5   avg 1526ms
 *   ~72,000 est ( 51,429 real)                5/5   avg 1523ms
 *
 * 35/35, with latency flat to 51k real tokens. The cliff did not reproduce.
 * Two things follow. First, the 18,000 budget was calibrated against a
 * transient upstream problem that no longer exists — and the retry and
 * cold-start warm-up added since are what now cover the flakiness it was
 * dodging. Second, the estimator is pessimistic by design (3.5 chars/token):
 * 32,000 ESTIMATED tokens measured as 22,911 real ones, about 40% high. Every
 * number in this file is in estimated tokens, so the real request is smaller
 * than it says — which is the safe direction to be wrong in.

/**
 * The ceiling we impose on ourselves, well below the model's 131,072.
 *
 * Not a reliability limit — the measurement above found none up to 51k real
