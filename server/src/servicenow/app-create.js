/**
 * WI-5 — creating a REAL custom application.
 *
 * THE DEFECT. `create_record` on `sys_scope` produced a record with
 * `sys_class_name: "sys_scope"`, an empty `scope`, and no version — a husk.
 * Studio does not list it and nothing can be developed inside it. The model had
 * correctly refused one turn earlier and then complied anyway with invented
 * field values, which is why the boundary is enforced in `tools.js` rather than
 * asked for in a prompt.
 *
 * The constructive half is here. `now-sdk init` DOES create a real application:
 * it scaffolds a workspace and `install` writes a `sys_app` record — the same
 * path that produced `x_2196302_nwforge`. The build output even names it
 * (`dist/app/scope/sys_app_<scopeId>.xml`), which is the difference between an
 * application and a husk in one filename.
 *
 * Scope naming is the part that has to be right FIRST, because a bad prefix is
 * only a warning and then the app "may not install correctly" (§3):
 *
 *   - must start with the instance's vendor prefix, read live from
 *     `glide.appcreator.company.code` — never hardcoded;
 *   - 18 characters maximum, TOTAL. With `x_2196302_` that leaves 8.
 *
 * So validation happens before anything is scaffolded, and it is pure and
 * offline-testable: getting told "two characters too long" costs a second,
 * while finding out after an install costs a broken application.
