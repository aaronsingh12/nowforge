/**
 * The SDK workspace registry.
 *
 * There has only ever been one workspace — `server/fluent-workspace`, scope
 * `x_2196302_nwforge` — and `fluent.js` reaches it through a module-level
 * constant. That is correct for authoring, where every managed source belongs
 * to the one application we install. It is not enough for two questions this
 * phase asks:
 *
 *   1. "which of the 743 scopes on this instance do WE manage?" — the
 *      Applications page needs an answer that is derived, not hardcoded, or it
 *      becomes another stale platform list (trap #28);
 *   2. "which scoped update set does this row belong in?" — the capture sweep
 *      keys on the ROW's application (§33 / trap #72), so it needs to look a
 *      scope up rather than assume the only one it knows.
 *
 * So the mapping scope → workspace becomes DATA that is discovered by scanning
 * for `now.config.json`, rather than a constant that happens to be right while
 * the count is one. Adding a second scoped application is then a directory,
 * not an edit here.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT done: this module does not create workspaces, install, or
 * spawn the SDK. It answers "what is on disk, and what scope does it claim".
 * `fluent.js` remains the only thing that runs `now-sdk`.
