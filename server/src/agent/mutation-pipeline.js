 * classification rule can be asserted offline against recorded fixtures. This
 * one does the two round trips those rules depend on, and both are optional:
 * a verification that cannot be performed reports `unverified` with a reason,
 * and NEVER reports success. "We could not check" and "we checked and it was
 * fine" must not render the same way, which is the whole lesson of the defect
 * this exists for.

 * cheap decisive signal — `sys_mod_count` and `sys_updated_on` frozen.
