/**
 * Bounded retry for the model call, and only for the model call.
 *
 * This exists because of a measurement, not a hunch. A session kept failing
 * with `Internal Server Error (ref: …)` from Ollama's cloud shim. Replaying the
 * captured request body showed something that looked at first like a size
 * limit — 111KB failed, 88KB passed — and the obvious "fix" would have been to
 * truncate history hard. Sending the SAME body six times showed what it
 * actually is:
 *
 *   the full failing request   111,412B   4/6 ok
 *   the same, without tools     88,094B   5/6 ok
 *   half the history            80,314B   6/6 ok
 *
 * Nothing is deterministic. The upstream is simply flaky, with failure
 * probability rising with request size, so an earlier bisect showing 24 tools
 * failing while 30 tools passed was noise being read as signal. Truncating the
 * agent's memory to work around that would have degraded it for no reason.
 *
 * What is safe to retry: this wraps the LLM request ONLY. It is a read, it
 * writes nothing to the instance, and tool execution sits outside it — a
 * mutation approved at the gate is never re-run by this.
 *
 * What is NOT retried: any 4xx other than 408/429. Those are our own malformed
 * request, and retrying one three times turns a clear bug into a slow one —
 * which is exactly how the `invalid message content type: <nil>` defect stayed
 * invisible for as long as it did.
 *
 * Every retry is logged at warn. A silent retry would hide an upstream getting
 * steadily worse behind a slightly slower app.

 * A cold start is not a blip, and must not be waited on like one.

 * `finish_reason: load` means the backend was loading the model and generated
 * nothing. For a 120b cloud model that takes far longer than the 600ms/1.8s a
 * 5xx deserves, so the generic backoff burned all three attempts inside ~2.4s
 * and reported failure while the model was still coming up — observed exactly
 * that way in a live session.
 *
 * D-7 changed how that wait is spent. Sleeping longer was guesswork about how
 * long a load takes; instead the caller now supplies a `beforeRetry` warm-up
 * that issues a one-token request and BLOCKS until the model is resident. The
 * wait is therefore the load itself rather than an estimate of it, and these
 * delays shrink to what they should always have been — a short settle before
 * the real call, not a stand-in for the load.
