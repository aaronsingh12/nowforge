 * A6 — the stalled turn
 *
 * MEASURED on gpt-oss:120b-cloud, twice in three runs of the C-4 acceptance.
 * Asked to "make the justification field mandatory only when duration is
 * Permanent", the model resolved the item, read its variables, quoted the two
 * correct sys_ids and the correct choice value in a tidy table — and then
 * ended the turn with "Shall I create this UI Policy now?".
 *
 * Nothing was created, and nothing said so. From the outside a stalled turn
 * looks exactly like a completed one: prose arrives, the stream closes.
 *
 * Asking harder does not fix it. The system prompt already said the approval
 * gate IS the confirmation and to call the tool; the model asked anyway, which
 * is §20's lesson again — three attempts of prose had not moved this model, and
 * one dictionary listing moved it immediately. So this is a guard, and the
 * evidence it feeds back is the thing the model demonstrably did not have: the
 * fact that its question reached nobody.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. It fires only when ALL of:
 *   - the turn is ending with no tool call at all,
 *   - the assistant's last line asks to proceed,
 *   - the user's own message was an instruction to change something,
 *   - and it has not already fired this turn.
 * A genuine clarifying question ("which of these two items did you mean?") does
 * not match, because it does not ask for permission to proceed.
